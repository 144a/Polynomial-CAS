# Polynomial-CAS
A small attempt at understanding how a large expandable CAS is built, focusing on polynomial functions

As of now, the program is currently only able to convert into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) an expression tree. However, I believe that it is not worth
my time to attempt to finish this project in processing. I will continue this in Java.
