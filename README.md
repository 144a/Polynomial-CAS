# Polynomial-CAS
A small attempt at understanding how a large expandable CAS is built, focusing on polynomial functions

As of now, the program is currently only able to convert into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
I am currently implementing the node class to then convert to an expression tree, which will then handle multiple functions
